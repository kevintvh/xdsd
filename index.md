XDSD is an open software development methodology that aims
to reduce risks and improve quality in a project of almost any size.
At the moment, there are four fundamental principles:

 * Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables
 * Defects are planned and don't block delivery
 * Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions
 * Master branch is read-only
